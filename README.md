# Fireworks
A simple pixelated rendering of a simple 3D scene with fireworks using Rust and the pixels and winit crates.
<br>
<p>This repo is meant as art and not to be an actual useful pixel render framework or anything like that. Please adapt this to your liking and excuse my bad code.
There is quite a bit of refactoring possible for more efficient and better readable code and maybe that will happen as I learn more about Rust, but I can't promise anything.</p>
<br>
<p>Have fun coding!</p>
